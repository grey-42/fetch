
Director, Data Architecture:

I have completed my initial review of the data provided in the JSON files we receive for 'brands', 'receipts', and 'users'.

These files do provide a substantive basis to begin data analysis in order to create relational and analytic models in support of our data strategy.  However, I have discovered several issues that need to be addressed both with the data provider and in support of the data ingestion processes required to make use of this information.

I recommend setting up time to discuss the required project tasks directly. 

These are some of the issues identified in the initial review:

- We have 'receipt' and 'receipt line item' data in the same JSON file with nonstandard data contents.

- Recent records are often missing barcodes, which we will require for item identification

- The data set contains no 'item' information separate from the brand and receipt data.  We need an inventory table.

- The 'category' data within the brand and receipt files are not consistent.  We need to create a category list and develop a cleansing process.

We need to build our relational model using best practices and business requirements, then create appropriate data cleansing and ingestion processes to populate that model accurately.

I look forward to speaking further.

Best regards,  

Greg Anderson
